# Algorithms Practice

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to my journey of practicing and understanding various algorithms. Here, I explore different algorithmic concepts, ranging from fundamental data structures to complex problem-solving techniques.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to:
- Improve my problem-solving skills.
- Get a deeper understanding of algorithmic design and analysis.
- Prepare for technical interviews and coding challenges.

## Algorithms Covered
In this repository, I work on several types of algorithms, including but not limited to:
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms
- Graph Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Divide and Conquer
- Backtracking
- And many more...

## Structure
Each algorithm or concept has its own directory, which includes:
- The implementation of the algorithm.
- A brief description and comments explaining the logic.
- Example input and output.
- Test cases (where applicable).

## Contributing
While this is a personal practice repository, any constructive feedback, suggestions, or contributions to improve the existing algorithms or add new ones are always welcome!

## Contact
Feel free to contact me for any questions or discussions related to algorithms and coding practices.

Happy Coding!
